# Task 1 - Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using numerical transaction data.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Contains 284,807 transactions with 492 fraudulent cases.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Algorithms: Random Forest Classifier
- Feature Scaling: StandardScaler

## Steps Performed
1. Data Loading and Exploration  
2. Train-Test Split  
3. Data Standardization  
4. Model Training using RandomForestClassifier  
5. Model Evaluation using Accuracy and Confusion Matrix  

## Results
- Achieved ~99.9% Accuracy on Test Data  
- Detected fraudulent transactions effectively
- Accuracy: 0.9991
Confusion Matrix:
[[56861 5]
[ 52 44]]
